# midimoc
Shell (bash) script to operate music player (moc) with midi controller (Korg nanokontrol2)

There are a lot of midi controllers or midi keyboards available.
What if you want to launch a (shell) command by pressing a key or turning a knob on your controller?
Midimoc can do this - despite it needs a lot of optimization.
As the name midimoc suggests, it tries to operate the console music player (moc, mocp) with the midi controller nanokontrol2 (from Korg).
